# About Me

My name is Patrick O'Melveny, my pronouns are he/him/his.
I'm a second year masters student at San Francisco State University.

My research under [Dusty Ross](https://sites.google.com/view/rossd) is currently on the log-concavity of the characteristic polynomial of matroids.
I am interested in Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics and their intersections.

I will be applying to Ph.D. programs in mathematics for the 2022-2023 academic year.
